## Bellman Equation.
The Bellman Equation is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning, a branch of 
machine learning. It helps agents make decisions by evaluating the value of different 
states and actions based on potential future rewards. 

#### Here’s a breakdown:
* Bellman Equation

The Bellman Equation is a recursive formula that expresses the value of a state as the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the next state. Mathematically, it can be written as:

* V(s)=amax​[R(s,a)+γs′∑​P(s′∣s,a)V(s′)]
Where:

  * ( V(s) ): The value of state ( s ), representing the long-term reward of being in that state.
  * ( R(s, a) ): The immediate reward received for taking action ( a ) in state ( s ).
  * ( \gamma ): The discount factor (between 0 and 1) that determines the importance of future rewards compared to immediate rewards.
  * ( P(s’|s, a) ): The probability of transitioning to state ( s’ ) from state ( s ) by taking action ( a ).
  * ( \max_a ): The optimal action that maximizes the expected value of future rewards12.

* Importance in Machine Learning
   * In reinforcement learning, the Bellman Equation is crucial for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It helps in finding the optimal policy, which is a strategy that defines the best action to take in each state to maximize cumulative rewards over time
