In reinforcement learning, the discount factor, denoted as γ
 (gamma), is a crucial parameter that determines the importance of future rewards. It is a scalar value between 0 and 1.
Here’s a breakdown of its role:


Immediate vs. Future Rewards: The discount factor balances the agent’s preference for immediate rewards versus future rewards. A higher γ
 (close to 1) means the agent values future rewards almost as much as immediate rewards. Conversely, a lower γ
 (close to 0) means the agent prioritizes immediate rewards more12.


Mathematical Representation: The total reward an agent aims to maximize is represented as the sum of discounted future rewards:
Rt​=rt​+γrt+1​+γ2rt+2​+γ3rt+3​+…
Here, ( r_t ) is the reward at time step ( t ), and ( \gamma ) determines how much future rewards are discounted2.


Convergence and Stability: The discount factor ensures that the sum of rewards remains finite and helps in the convergence
of algorithms like Q-learning and policy gradients3.
The return in reinforcement learning is the sum of rewards an agent receives over time, adjusted by the discount factor (γ
). The discount factor, typically a value slightly less than 1 (e.g., 0.9), reduces the weight of future rewards compared to immediate rewards. This makes the agent “impatient,” valuing rewards received sooner more highly than those received later.
Mathematically, the return ( G_t ) at time step ( t ) is defined as:
Gt​=Rt+1​+γRt+2​+γ2Rt+3​+γ3Rt+4​+…
where ( R_{t+k} ) is the reward received at time step ( t+k ).
In your Mars Rover example, if the rewards are 0 at the first few steps and 100 at the terminal state, the return would be calculated as:
G=0+γ⋅0+γ2⋅0+γ3⋅100
With a discount factor of 0.9, this becomes:
G=0.93⋅100=0.729⋅100=72.9
This approach helps the agent prioritize actions that lead to quicker rewards, balancing the trade-off between immediate and future gains.

Here’s a summary of your example:


Discount Factor of 0.5: This means each subsequent reward is worth half as much as the previous one.


Return Calculation: For a sequence of rewards starting from state 4 and moving left:
G=0+0.5⋅0+0.52⋅0+0.53⋅100=0.53⋅100=12.5


Financial Analogy: The discount factor can be likened to the time value of money in financial applications, where a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future due to potential interest earnings.


Different Actions, Different Returns: Depending on the actions taken (e.g., always going left or right), the returns will vary. For instance, always going right from state 4 results in:
G=0+0.5⋅0+0.52⋅40=10


State-Dependent Actions: By choosing actions based on the current state, you can optimize the return. For example, going left in states 2, 3, and 4, but right in state 5, results in different returns for each state.


This approach helps illustrate how the discount factor influences the agent’s decision-making process by prioritizing immediate rewards over distant ones. I
